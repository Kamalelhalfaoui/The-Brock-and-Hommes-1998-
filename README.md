# The-Brock-and-Hommes-1998-
The Brock and Hommes (1998) model is a well-known agent-based model in the field of economics, particularly in the study of financial markets and asset pricing. It aims to capture the dynamics of asset prices by modeling the behavior of heterogeneous agents who have different trading strategies and learning mechanisms.
